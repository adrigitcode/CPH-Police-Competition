### SQL queries on the Copenhagen Police Records

Award in the category 'Most interesting historical fact'  üèÜ

Variable names have been changed and some details are hidden due to confidentiality and preservation of data privacy.

select round(avg(children)) as avgChildren, count(fromdate) from matPersonCube group by children order by round(avg(children))

- [x] __Distribution of locations in 2000__

select round(avg(children)) as avgChildren, lat, lon, street, strnro from matPersonCube where lat is NOT NULL and
lon is NOT NULL and year(fromdate) = 2000 group by lat, lon, street order by round(avg(children)) desc;
