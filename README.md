# CPH Police Competition - [IT University of Copenhagen](https://en.itu.dk/)

### SQL queries on the Copenhagen Police Records

.: Award in the category 'Most interesting historical fact'  üèÜ :.

I was not expecting this honor during the ceremony, although I did have fun and tried my best when answering. 

Forever grateful to professor [Rasmus Pagh](http://www.itu.dk/people/pagh/) and Jeppe Christensen from The Copenhagen City Archives. It's been one of the best moments from Denmark.

I tried a multidimensional view of the data to know if the number of changing address has a relation with the number of children on average. Also, if people have preferences in living in some areas depending on the number of children they have.

Variable names were modified and some details hidden due to confidentiality and preservation of data privacy.

&nbsp;

- [x] __Creating a view__

```sql

create view totalChildren as (select persId, count(*) children
from relationship
where rel='parent'
group by persId)

```

&nbsp;

- [x] __Create a Cube__

```sql

create view personCube as
(select person.id, gender, birthdate, fromdate, street, strnro, lat, lon, children, job
from person, address, totalChildren, post
where person.id = address.persId and person.id = totalChildren.persId and person.id = post.persId);

```

&nbsp;

- [x] __Materialize the Cube__

```sql

create table matPersonCube as (select birthdate, fromdate, street, strnro, lat, lon, children, 
job, count(*) c from personCube group by birthdate, fromdate, street, strnro, lat, lon, children, job)

```

&nbsp;

- [x] __Create indexes for Cube__

```sql

create index idx1 on matPersonCube(children, fromdate, job);

```

```sql

create index idx2 on matPersonCube(children, lat, lon, street, strnro);

```

&nbsp;

- [x] __Distribution of changing address__

```sql

select round(avg(children)) as avgChildren, count(fromdate) 
from matPersonCube 
group by children 
order by round(avg(children)) desc;

```

&nbsp;

- [x] __Distribution of locations in 2000__

```sql

select round(avg(children)) as avgChildren, lat, lon, street, strnro 
from matPersonCube 
where lat is NOT NULL andlon is NOT NULL and year(fromdate) = 2000 
group by lat, lon, street 
order by round(avg(children)) desc;

```
